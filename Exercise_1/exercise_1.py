""" 
(a) Unsupervised Learning  : Because products bought toguether are a set of unlabled data set where the  solving learning problem includes finding patterns and relashionships between the objects.
(b) Reinforcement Learning : Because a chess computer needs to react with the player and take actions based on the previous outcome of the data set .
(c) Supervised Learning    : Because the spam recognition system  needs to classify the set of emails which is a set of labeled data.
(d) Supervised Learning    : Because the classification of applicants system  needs to classify the set of applicants as credit-worthy or unworthy which is a set of labeled data.
(e) Supervised Learning    : Because the Object recognition in computer vision needs to classify the set of objets based on their features .
(f) Reinforcement Learning : Because the Robot neds to be trained  and interact based on the obsticales and take actions to get to the end point.
(g) Unsupervised Learning  : Because the task involves invoves clustering images with is a set of unlabled data based on groups.
